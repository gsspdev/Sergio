# Sergio

## Sergio is an alternative keyboard designed to optimize the benefits of allternative keyboard layouts while minimizing the learning curve from QWERTY

### Easy to learn

#### Sergio is easy to pick up because it was designed to retain the finger and key relationships of QWERTY IE the left index finger is used to access "f", "v", "b", "r", "t", and "g" as it does in qwerty, but the exact positions of the keys have changed

### Efficient

#### By cross referencing relative difficulties of hitting keys with the frequency of characters in the English language, the most common letters have been moved to the home row and other easy to access places. The result is less hand movement and quicker inputs.

### VIM-compatible

#### Usable with standard VIM keybindings. Why not be a 10x engineer?
