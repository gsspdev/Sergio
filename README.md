# Sergio

## Features

### Sergio is an alternative keyboard designed to optimize the benefits of allternative keyboard layouts while minimizing the learning curve from QWERTY

#### Easy to learn

##### Sergio is easy to pick up because it was designed to retain the finger and key relationships of QWERTY IE the left index finger is used to access "f", "v", "b", "r", "t", and "g" as it does in qwerty, but the exact positions of the keys have changed

#### Efficient

##### By cross referencing relative difficulties of hitting keys with the frequency of characters in the English language, the most common letters have been moved to the home row and other easy to access places. The result is less hand movement and quicker inputs.

#### VIM-compatible

##### Usable with standard VIM keybindings. Why not be a 10x engineer?

## Installation

### Copy the layout(s) to a Keyboard Layouts directory. Choose one of the following options:

#### Option 1 (recommended). Copy Workman.bundle to /Library/Keyboard Layouts/. It requires administrator rights but this enables the layout system-wide, including the OS X login screen.

#### To enable input options on the login window, check the option in System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Options > Show Input menu in login window.

#### Option 2. Copy Workman.bundle to ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/. It doesn't require admin rights. The layout is only available to the currently logged-in user.

### Log out of OS X and log back in.

### Open System Preferences > Language & Region > Keyboard Preferences > Input Sources and enable the Workman layout of your choice.

### Make sure that the Show Input menu in menu bar box is checked.

#### To switch quickly between layouts you can press Command+Space or Command+Option+Space. This hotkey combination conflicts with the default settings for showing Spotlight. Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts and ensure the Spotlight shorcut is different from the Keyboard and Input Sources shortcuts.
